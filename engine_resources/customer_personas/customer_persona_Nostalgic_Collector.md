## **📖 Persona Story: Jason Ramirez**

I’m Jason. I’m 34, married with two kids, and work in IT support. When I was younger, I had a solid Pokémon card collection—Base Set, Jungle, Fossil, all that—but during a move, my binder vanished. I was crushed. Now that I’m older and have a steady job, I’m finally doing what 9-year-old me dreamed of: getting those cards back, but in even better condition.

I found Deez Collectibles while browsing WhatNot and was drawn to their focus on vintage cards. What really hooked me was that it didn’t feel like a hustle—it felt like someone who *gets* the emotional connection. I’m not looking to flip cards. I’m looking to relive something I lost, and maybe build something I can share with my son when he gets older. I’ve made a few impulse bids that I later felt unsure about, so I’m cautious now—if I feel like a seller is pushing aggression, I’ll bounce.

---

# **❓1. What influences me to trust (or distrust) a seller on WhatNot?**

#### What builds trust:

* **Real, relatable energy**: If the seller talks like a human, not a aggression or fear-mongering machine. If they share their own collecting stories, I feel a connection. I trust people who clearly love the hobby—not just the money.

* **Transparency**: When sellers show the cards up close, talk about the condition honestly (even flaws), and explain what makes a card valuable, it makes me feel they’re not hiding anything.

* **Consistency**: If someone runs regular streams and I see familiar faces in the chat, that’s a sign they’re trusted by the community. Returning buyers \= good sign.

* **Mods**: Mods keep the chat engaged. They hype up certain cards. They are informative and help regulate the chat.

* **Rewards Club**: Seeing others in the stream hitting new tiers (e.g. Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, and Diamond) gives them confidence. (I have to know about the platform a little more to understand the value of seeing higher tier rewards members)

* **Safe packaging & delivery reviews**: I check reviews on WhatNot. If people say the cards arrived fast and in good shape, I’m more likely to buy.

* **Genuine engagement**: When a seller remembers repeat buyers or chats with us casually, it gives that “local comic shop” vibe—even online. 

* **Direct engagement:** Seller is personally involved in helping with a buyer’s personal requests.

#### What makes me suspicious or bounce:

* **Too pushy**: When everything’s “🔥 insane deal\!” or “don’t miss out\!” it triggers my inner skeptic. I’ve been burned by hype before and hate feeling tricked. 

* **No camera clarity or card details**: If I can’t clearly see the condition or if they avoid talking about it, I assume they’re hiding something.

* **Pressure tactics (Too aggressive)**: “Only 5 seconds left\! Buy now or regret forever\!”—nah, I don’t play that game. Seller is TOO aggressive \- “You guys suck, you’re not bidding high enough”. Don’t berate the bidders/viewers. Making the audience feel bad for low bids or lack of interaction.  Implying (via tone, demeanor, or both) that the audience is stupid.

* **Low Viewership/Reviews:** If there are low views or reviews (especially negative) I am not sure I can trust this stream.

👉 **Why this matters**: I’m not here just to buy cards—I’m here to feel something. I want to *trust* that the card I’m buying is worth the money emotionally and financially. If I don’t feel that, I’m gone—even if the card’s rare.

# **🎯 What Cards or Sets I Value Most — and Why**

## **🔥 My Top Targets:**

* #### Team Rocket  

  * #### *Why*: These hit during my “peak Poké-phase.” First set where Pokémon ever went dark. The art got cooler, the stories behind the cards deeper. Team Rocket especially hits different—it felt rebellious, and I loved that. Latest update: a brand new Rocket is being released. 

* #### WOTC-Era Promos (like Ancient Mew, Movie Cards) 

  * #### *Why*: These were cards you couldn’t just buy at a store. You had to *be there*—at the movies, an event, or part of the club. Owning one again feels like being part of an exclusive memory club. 

* #### Base Set (especially 1st Edition or Shadowless) 

  * *Why*: This is where it all started. The art, the feel, the memories—these are the cards I had (or wanted) as a kid. Owning a Base Set Charizard, even in rough condition, feels like reclaiming a childhood dream.

* ####  Gym Challenge / Gym Hero 

  * *Why*: First set where they actually show the gym trainer on the card. The card has the original trainer who trained the Pokémon that they owned. They want to be that trainer. Nostalgia from Ash’s journey where he had to beat the trainers.

* #### Jungle & Fossil Sets 

  * *Why*: These were my next step after the Base Set as a kid. I remember pulling a Jungle Pikachu and thinking it was the greatest thing ever. These sets are more affordable now, but still emotionally valuable.

* #### Neo / Neo Revelation / Neo Destiny Series 

  * *Why*: The first set where they introduced light AND dark Pokémon.

#### 

# **💔 What I don’t care about as much:**

* **Modern sets (unless they’re heavy on nostalgia)**:

  * I don’t follow the newer Pokémon generations, so newer cards with Pokémon I don’t recognize mean little to me unless the art throws back to the ‘90s.

* **Investment cards/slabs without story**:

  * If a PSA 10 (CGC 10\) card is hyped for its price but doesn’t connect to my past, I’m not interested. I care more about meaning than market value.

* **Condition:**

  * Does not need to be in mint condition, as long as it is ‘good enough’ to connect with my childhood and it is from the era that I was collecting.

* **Common cards:**

  * Random (less popular cards).  Even if it is a vintage card, unless I am trying to complete a master set, I only care about the main, most popular cards (e.g. Pickachu, Charmander).

---

### **👉 Why this matters:**

I’m not collecting to build a portfolio — I’m collecting to **rebuild my identity**. These cards are time machines. I’ll pay more for a beat-up card I emotionally connect with than for a pristine one I don’t recognize.

So when a seller **knows the backstory of a card, ties it into the era, or shows they “get it,”** I’m far more likely to engage and buy.

---

# **💸 How I Decide What to Spend on a Vintage Card**

**It’s mostly emotional, but I tell myself it’s logical. Here’s my real process:**

---

## **✅ Cards I** 

#### **Really**

####  **Want (Childhood Grails):**

* **Max Budget:** I’ve spent $200–$400+ on individual cards if it’s something I lost as a kid (e.g., Base Set Charizard, 1st Ed. Machamp).

* **Mental Math:** I justify it by telling myself, *“This is a once-in-a-lifetime card” or “I’ll pass this down to my kids.”  “This is the last card I need to complete my set, this stream has it now so I can save time by just buying it now.”*

* **Trigger Words:** If a seller mentions “Fire card”, “this one’s a banger”, “highly requested”, “hard to find”, “hard to find in this condition”, “OG collectors love this”, “first print run”, “only one we’re gonna run”, “only copy”  (time-remaining, e.g. “2-seconds”), Calling out who is engaged in the bidding war. I’m more likely to throw logic out the window and bid.

---

## **⚖️ Cards I Like But Don’t Usually Buy**

#### Need:

* **Comfort Zone:** I usually aim for under $10–$15.

* **Factors That Influence Me:**

  * **Urgency/Hype**: Once in a lifetime, and it’s going to go fast.

  * **Condition clarity**: If I can see every angle and it looks good, I’m in.

  * **Stream vibe**: If I trust the seller and enjoy the stream, I’ll pay more just to support them.

  * **Bundling**: I’ll justify spending more if I can grab a few cards in one shot (e.g., base \+ jungle \+ fossil).

---

## **📉 Cards I’ll Avoid or Lowball:**

* **Overhyped or Modern**: If it’s a new card dressed in vintage-style art, I cap out at $20 or less.

* **Graded cards I don’t understand**: If I’m unsure why a slab is priced at $150+, I won’t bid—unless the seller explains the value clearly.

* **Pokémon I don’t know or care about:** If I am not certain what Pokémon this is or why I should care, I’m out.

---

## **🧠 My “Emotional Justification Framework”:**

* *“How much would 9-year-old me freak out if I owned this?”*

* *“Will this card still make me smile in 10 years?”*

* *“Do I trust this seller not to screw me over?”*

If all three answers are strong, I go for it—even if it hurts a little.

---

### 👉 Why this matters:

I often **don’t plan my spending ahead of time** — I **react emotionally in the moment**. But if I regret it later, I remember the *seller*. That’s why trust and storytelling during the auction stream matter so much.

---

# **📲 What Kind of Marketing Makes Me Click Through**

## **🔥 1\. Nostalgia-First Visuals**

* **Before/After childhood shots**: Like a photo of an old binder next to a pristine Base Set holo.

* **Vintage card close-ups** with worn edges, faded art, or 1st Edition stamps — they *look* like memory triggers.

* *Why it works*: It taps into emotion before logic. I don’t need to read a caption — I *feel* the memory and want to reconnect with it.

---

## **🧠 2\. Story-Driven Captions or Ads**

* **“Did your mom throw your binder away?”** or **“The card you lost at recess is waiting for you.”**

* Short reels or ads that start with a relatable line: *“Remember pulling this card in ‘99?”*

* *Why it works*: It’s not selling a product; it’s selling a *moment from my life*. I’ll click because I want to see if I can get that moment back.

---

## **📦 3\. Sneak Peeks of What’s in the Auction**

* **“We’re running THIS beauty tonight 🔥”** with a photo of a vintage holo (esp. Charizard, Blastoise, or a WOTC promo).

* **Auction lineups** posted like a teaser menu: “Base Set Zapdos, Jungle Snorlax, Fossil Gengar — all going live tonight.”

* *Why it works*: I don’t want to *miss out* on cards I actually want. If I see a card I’m chasing, I’ll click in.

---

## **🎙️ 4\. Authentic Faces & Familiar Vibes**

* A quick video of the seller saying, *“Hey collectors, I just pulled this out of storage — we’re going back to ‘99 tonight.”*

* No overproduced graphics — just warm, real faces who *feel* like collectors, not salespeople.

* *Why it works*: Trust. It feels like someone from the community, not an ad agency.

---

## **🎁 5\. Surprise or Mystery Elements**

* “I’m opening a vintage mystery box from my childhood tonight—no idea what’s inside.”

* “Every order tonight gets a free 1999 Topps sticker — let’s relive it.”

* *Why it works*: I love surprises. Even if I don’t win, being there feels fun and low-risk.

---

## **❌ What I ignore:**

* Graphics that feel too modern or flashy with “BUY NOW” energy.

* Marketing that focuses only on *value* or *ROI (non-emotional) (e.g. high-value cards that I probably never owned anyway)*. I’m not flipping.

* Streams that are disorganized, not visually appealing — feels scammy or clickbait-y.

---

### 👉 Why this matters:

I’m not driven by scarcity or FOMO like the hype crowd — I’m driven by **connection and memory**. If your marketing speaks to the heart of who I was as a kid, I’m already halfway through the door.
