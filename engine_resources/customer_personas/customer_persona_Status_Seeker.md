# **🧠 My Story (as Tyler “T-Money” Reyes)**

I’m 26, working a flexible IT job, and I spend a *lot* of time on WhatNot and Discord during breaks or after hours. I grew up on Pokémon, sure, but I’m not in this for nostalgia — I’m in it for *the flex*. When a new set drops, I want to be one of the first to crack that ETB live or show off a chase card in my WhatNot profile. I’ve bought slabs before, but I get bored fast — unless it’s trending or people are talking about it, I’m onto the next thing.

I’ll admit, I’ve dropped money on cards I regretted, especially when the hype faded quick. But I don’t care. That rush when I win a live auction, or when I grab one of the “last 3 spots” in a break and hit something nuts? That’s what I chase. I follow sellers who move fast, talk fast, and know what’s hot before it even drops. If you’re not hyped, I’m not watching.

# **✅ What Makes Me Trust a Seller on WhatNot**

* **Energy \+ Hype**: If you’re not excited, I’m gone. I trust sellers who **match the hype** of the product. Talk fast, react big when there’s a hit, keep the energy up.

  * **Why**: It makes me feel like we’re in it together — like this pull *matters*. A slow, flat seller feels like they don’t care.

* **Real-Time Proof of Heat**: Show me what’s inside *before* I buy — display the top hits, talk about value, show recent bangers pulled in your stream.

  * **Why**: I want proof I’m not wasting money on mid-tier packs. Give me a reason to believe this break could change my night.

* **Scarcity Tactics**: Limited breaks, countdowns, “only 2 spots left” — I trust sellers who create urgency *without feeling fake*.

  * **Why**: Scarcity gets me pumped, but if it feels scripted or overdone, I bounce. It’s gotta feel *organic*.

* **Community Cred**: If your name pops up in Discord, or other WhatNot sellers mention you, that’s big. Bonus if people in your stream are hyping you up too.

  * **Why**: I’m watching the *chat* as much as you. If everyone’s vibing, I feel safe. If it’s dead or weird, I dip.

* **Transparency \+ Fairness**: Tell me the odds. Show sealed product. Randomize fairly. I love hype, but I also want the *illusion of fairness*.

  * **Why**: I’ve been burned before by shady pack weights and rerolls. If I don’t feel you’re straight with us, I won’t be back.

# **❌ What Makes Me Avoid a Seller**

* Low energy or bad camera angles

* Too many filler cards and not enough heat

* Unclear pricing or hidden fees

* No preview of hits or value talk

* Acting too “salesy” — if it feels forced, I check out

---

Oh man, easy — if I’m scrolling WhatNot and your stream flashes a card that hits these boxes, I’m **stopping cold**:

# **🔥 Cards That Instantly Catch My Attention**

* **Chase Cards from the Newest Set**

  * Stuff like *Charizard alt arts*, *gold cards*, *rainbow rares*, or anything that’s the \#1 or \#2 chase card in the latest drop.

  * **Why**: I already saw it teased on TikTok or Reddit — if you’ve got it in-hand, I *need* to see if you’ll pull another.

* **Limited Promos or Exclusive Drops**

  * Think Pokémon Center exclusives, Japanese promo cards, or event-only releases. Especially if it’s sealed and looks premium.

  * **Why**: I want things other people don’t have. If I can post a card and people ask “where’d you get that?” — that’s the win.

* **Graded Heat (Slabs) With Flash**

  * BGS 10 Black Labels, PSA 10 Zards, anything that visually pops and has a grade people flex over.

  * **Why**: It’s not just about the card — it’s about the *status*. If it’s slabbed and shining under the lights, I’m looking.

* **Alt Arts or “Weird Cool” Cards**

  * Cards with unique artwork, like the Mewtwo VSTAR battling Charizard or those graffiti-style Japanese cards.

  * **Why**: I’m visual. I want something that looks crazy on camera. Even if it’s not super valuable, if it *looks hot*, I’m interested.

* **Bundles or Mystery Packs with a Hint of Jackpot**

  * Show me someone pulling a $100+ card from a mystery pack — I’m *locked in*.

  * **Why**: I’m a gambler at heart. I want that thrill of “what if I hit the big one?”

---

# **🚫 What I Scroll Past**

* Commons, reverses, or bulk — unless they’re vintage

* Vintage cards that aren’t clean (if you’re selling a beat-up old Pikachu, skip it)

* Sellers not showing cards up close or using bad lighting

* Auctions without a preview of *what’s in the set*

---

# **🎯 Marketing That Actually Gets Me to Click**

If you want me — Tyler “T-Money” Reyes, resident FOMO-fueled buyer — to *click*, tap, or swipe up on your promo? You need to **trigger my brain’s hype center** instantly. I scroll *fast*, so here’s what breaks through:

* **Visual Teasers with “🔥” Cards Front and Center**

  * You show a crisp image or short video of a chase card or fire pull — slabbed, sparkly, well-lit — with bold text like “LIVE NOW – 3 Packs Left” or “Last Chance to Hit the 🔥 Alt Art.”

  * **Why**: I don’t need context. If the *card* slaps, I’m in. I want to see what else is hiding in those packs.

* **Countdowns or Limited Drops (Urgency Language)**

  * “Going live in 10 min – Only 20 Mystery Packs\!” or “First 5 Buyers Get Bonus Slab\!” — I *hate* feeling like I missed out.

  * **Why**: I know the game. If you make it feel like I might lose a shot at something sick, I *have* to check.

* **Quick-Cut Reels of Live Pull Reactions**

  * You clip 10 seconds of someone screaming after pulling a hit and put it on IG, TikTok, or even a WhatNot story. Bonus if the chat’s going wild.

  * **Why**: I want to live that moment. I think, “That could’ve been *me*.” It creates instant envy.

* **Pinned Comments or Captions with Heat Words**

  * Words like “Secret Rare,” “Insane Pull,” “Gold Zard Hit,” or “0.01% Odds — HIT\!” grab me even before the visuals sometimes.

  * **Why**: I’m conditioned to chase that language. It signals *value* and *momentum*.

* **Flash Sales or Hidden Deals (But Only if I Trust You)**

  * “Flash Drop — DM me ‘🔥’ for a secret slab deal” *works* if I’ve bought from you before or seen you in action.

  * **Why**: It feels like I’m in an underground club. But if you’re a rando, I won’t bite.

---

## **❌ Stuff I Ignore or Scroll Past**

* Over-designed graphics that look like Canva templates

* Ads with no visuals of cards (or just stock Pokémon logos)

* Wordy text posts with no hook

* Sellers promoting “great deals” without showing any heat

* Facebook posts that look like scams (low-res pics, poor grammar, etc.)

---

## **🧠 Why It Works This Way**

* I’m motivated by **speed, hype, and social proof**

* I want to feel like I’m part of an *in-the-know* crowd

* I want the *dopamine* rush of a crazy pull — and marketing that teases that moment works best

---

# **❤️ When I’m Into Custom/Fan-Made Cards**

Ahhh, custom cards — now that’s a *tricky one* for me, bro.

I’ve got a **love-hate thing** with fan-made cards. Done right, they’re straight-up 🔥 and I *want* them in my binder. Done wrong? Total cringe. So here’s how I feel, and how most of us hype-driven buyers like me react:

* **The Design Slaps**

  * If it looks premium — full-art, textured, shiny, edgy, maybe even borderline *illegal-looking* (like Goku vs. Pikachu or horror-Zard), I *want it*.

  * **Why**: I don’t care if it’s official. I care if it’ll make people say “Yo, where’d you get that?\!”

* **It Feels Like an Insider’s Collectible**

  * Stuff that you *only get* in a stream, limited to 25 made, serialized, hand-numbered — that’s 🔥.

  * **Why**: It feels like being part of a secret club. I missed out on some “stream-only” promos before, and it *still* bugs me.

* **Part of a Mystery Pack or Bonus**

  * If I pull a fan art card as a *bonus hit* in a mystery pack or slab deal, I’m hyped.

  * **Why**: It adds surprise. Even if I flip the card later, it made the break feel *customized*.

* **Streamer Signature or Branding**

  * If it’s your own card with your stream logo, limited run, or something that marks me as one of “your people” — that’s cool.

  * **Why**: I like repping sellers I vibe with. Makes it feel more personal.

---

## **❌ When I’m Not Into Them**

* **It Looks Cheap or Lazy**

  * Bad print quality, flat images, clipart vibes — instant trash bin.

  * **Why**: If it looks like a kid printed it on their home printer, it kills the whole break’s vibe.

* **Trying to Sell Them Like They’re Real Pokémon Cards**

  * If you act like a fan-made card holds the same value or slot as a real pull — I’m out.

  * **Why**: It feels scammy. These are bonuses, not base value.

* **Too Many in the Break**

  * If you’re stuffing every pack with fan-made cards and barely any legit Pokémon content, I’m skipping that stream.

  * **Why**: I came for the *real* heat. You can’t bait me with filler.

---

### 🧠 Bottom Line

* Fan cards should feel like **bonuses**, **flex pieces**, or **collectible art**, *not replacements* for official heat.

* I’ll show it off if it’s dope and rare.

* I’ll ignore it if it feels like filler or fake value.
