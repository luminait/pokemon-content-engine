# **🧍 A Story About Me (David)**

I’ve been collecting Pokémon cards since the Base Set dropped in the late ’90s. As a kid, I had a binder full of commons and a few shinies I cherished—until my mom gave them away during a spring cleaning session. Now that I’ve got a steady job in IT, I’ve turned my collection into a passion project. I don’t just collect—I build master sets, track population reports, and live for the thrill of snagging that last holo I need in gem mint.

I’m not here for hype—I’m here for legacy. My evenings are spent combing WhatNot streams and Discord servers looking for that one card to fill the gap. But I’m picky. I need clarity—centering, edgewear, surface, the whole deal. If a seller’s vague or doesn’t show corners? I’m out. But if I find someone I trust, I’ll come back week after week. I want my collection to speak for itself—complete, clean, and respected in the community.

# **What Makes a Seller Stand Out to me on WhatNot**

As a hardcore Pokémon collector, **what makes a seller stand out to me on WhatNot** comes down to three main things:

## **🔍 1\. Transparency & Accuracy**

* I want *crystal-clear photos*—especially for slabs and raw cards. I need to see corners, centering, whitening, and surface condition.

* Bonus points if the seller proactively calls out flaws *before* I have to ask.

* Graded cards should include PSA/BGS/CGC serial numbers so I can double-check the pop report.

**Why this matters:** I’ve been burned by poor lighting or sellers rushing through cards. I want to *trust* that what I’m seeing is what I’m getting.

---

## **🤝 2\. Consistency & Knowledge**

* Sellers who know what they’re talking about (set names, rarity symbols, print years) earn my respect.

* When a seller consistently streams high-quality cards that match my interests (like vintage sets or certain grades), I follow them and return often.

**Why this matters:** I’m not just impulse-buying—I’m curating a high-value collection. I need a seller who knows the difference between Base Set 2 and Shadowless, not just someone chasing views.

---

## **🧠 3\. Value-Driven Offers**

* Not just cheap prices, but *fair pricing* based on current market trends (TCGPlayer, eBay sold listings).

* Sellers who throw in occasional *collector bundles* or reward loyal bidders with perks stand out big time.

* Free shipping thresholds or “mystery slabs” can be nice if done right and not just a gimmick.

**Why this matters:** I spend hundreds, sometimes thousands, but I always calculate return on investment. I’ll pay more for trust and quality.

---

### Bonus:

* Clear communication in the chat.

* Reliable shipping and well-packaged cards.

* Being active in the community (Discord, Insta, etc.) builds long-term rapport.

---

Great—let’s talk about **how I research card values and decide what to pay** as a serious collector.

---

# **📈 My Process for Pricing Cards:**

## **🔹 Step 1: Cross-Check Marketplaces**

* **eBay Sold Listings**: I always filter for “Sold” to get real market value, not asking prices.

* **TCGPlayer**: I check both the “Market Price” and “Listing Trends” for raw cards.

* **PSA Price Guide \+ Pop Reports**: For slabs, I want to know how rare the grade is (Pop 5 vs Pop 500 makes a huge difference).

**Why:** Price fluctuation is real. Just because someone paid $100 last month doesn’t mean I will today—especially if more are popping up.

---

## **🔹 Step 2: Factor in Condition or Grading**

* For raw cards, I inspect edges, centering, surface, and whitening *myself* based on photos or videos.

* For slabs, I assess if the grade feels “strong” or “weak” (e.g., a PSA 9 with silvering is less desirable).

**Why:** Condition swings value *big time*—a “minty” raw card might beat a weak PSA 9 in my eyes.

---

## **🔹 Step 3: Apply My “Collector Math”**

* If a card is critical to completing a set, I’ll go a little over market—maybe 10–20%.

* For cards I already own or that are easy to find, I expect to pay *below* market.

* If it’s a bundle, I break it down card by card. I don’t get tricked by big numbers or flashy deals.

**Why:** I’m building long-term value. Every dollar counts when completing sets or reselling extras.

---

## **🚩 What Makes Me NOT Bid:**

* If a seller doesn’t name the set/version.

* If the condition is unclear or not shown in close-up.

* If prices are clearly inflated or “hype-based” with no market logic.

---

### Bottom Line:

I buy with my brain first, then my heart. If I can’t justify the value based on *objective data*, I walk away—even if it’s a childhood favorite card.

---

Awesome—let’s talk about **what frustrates me the most during live auctions** as a hardcore collector on WhatNot.

---

# **♦️Cards I connect With**

* #### Cards with visual flaws I remember (off-center, weird misprints, thick stamps) 

  * *Why*: As a kid, I thought my error cards were unique treasures. Now I actually collect those flaws intentionally. They feel “personal.”

# 

# **😤 Top Frustrations in Live Auctions**

## **🔹 1\. Poor Presentation of Cards**

* Cards not shown clearly (blurry cams, bad lighting, fast movement).

* No close-up of corners, edges, or back—especially on higher-value cards.

**Why:** I need to *verify condition* myself. If I can’t see it clearly, it’s a no-go. It wastes my time and breaks trust.

---

## **🔹 2\. Overhyped or Misrepresented Cards**

* Sellers calling a raw card “PSA 10-worthy” with no real basis.

* Mislabeling cards (e.g., saying it’s 1st Edition when it’s not).

**Why:** Accuracy is everything to me. I’m not here for flashy sales talk—I’m here for *facts* and *data*. Hype turns me off immediately.

---

## **🔹 3\. FOMO-Pushing Auction Tactics**

* Pressure phrases like “You’ll never see this again\!” or “This is going in someone’s PC forever\!”

* Constant time extensions just to milk bids.

**Why:** I don’t respond well to manipulative selling. I want a *fair, fast auction* with no psychological games.

---

## **🔹 4\. Auction Spam or Irrelevant Listings**

* Throwing random cards nobody wants just to fill time.

* Auctions dragging on without structure (no schedule, no card preview, no pacing).

**Why:** I tune in to *buy specific cards*, not to hang around for filler. My time is valuable. I’ll leave a stream that doesn’t respect that.

---

## **🔹 5\. Shipping & Fulfillment Issues**

* Sellers who ship late, use poor packaging, or mix up orders.

* Lack of tracking updates or communication post-auction.

**Why:** I’m spending serious money. A messed-up shipment could ruin a card’s value. I remember bad shipping experiences forever—and I don’t return.

---

### What I Actually Want:

* Streamlined auctions with previews of what’s coming.

* Professional sellers who show cards well, keep things moving, and speak like fellow collectors—not hype men.

* Auctions that feel *efficient* and *collector-friendly*, not chaotic.

---

Great—let’s dive into **how I feel about custom or fan art cards** as a hardcore Pokémon collector.

---

# **🎨 My Honest Take on Custom/Fan Art Cards:**

## **🔹 1\. Cool for Display—Not for My Collection**

* Some custom cards are absolutely stunning—I’ll admit, the artistry is legit.

* I might grab one or two *for fun* or to display on a shelf or desk.

* But they don’t go in my binders or slab sets. They’re **not part of my official collection**.

**Why:** My collecting goal is completion of *official* sets. Customs don’t count. They’re like side quests—not the main storyline.

---

## **🔹 2\. I Need a Clear Separation From Official Cards**

* If a seller mixes custom cards into a regular auction *without being crystal clear*, I get irritated.

* Labeling must be obvious: “CUSTOM CARD” or “FAN ART – NOT OFFICIAL.”

**Why:** I don’t want confusion, especially when buying fast in auctions. One slip-up and I’ve wasted money on a non-canon card.

---

## **🔹 3\. Not Worth Much in Terms of Value**

* I don’t see them appreciating like vintage or graded official cards.

* They have *personal* or *aesthetic* value, but no market investment value.

**Why:** I put money into cards that hold or grow in value. Custom cards are more like buying prints or merch—they’re cool, but they don’t belong in my portfolio.

---

## **🔹 4\. Best for Gift Packs, Add-ons, or Loyalty Rewards**

* I’m okay with getting them *for free* as a thank-you with orders or giveaways.

* Could be fun in a collector box as a bonus, but I wouldn’t pay premium prices.

**Why:** They add emotional flavor but not real collecting value.

---

### Bottom Line:

I respect the art and creativity—but as a completionist, **custom cards don’t count toward my collecting goals**, and I won’t pay serious money for them.

---

# **✅ Marketing That Works on Me:**

## **🔹 1\. Targeted, Visual Previews of Rare or Set-Specific Cards**

* Ads or posts showing *exact cards* I might be chasing (e.g., “🔥 Neo Destiny Holos dropping tonight\!” or “PSA 9 Shadowless Bundle Live Now\!”).

* I click when I see something I *recognize and need*—especially if it’s slabbed or low pop.

**Why:** I’m not browsing for fun—I’m on a mission. If your marketing shows me a card I’ve been tracking, you’ve got my attention.

---

## **🔹 2\. “Set Completion” or “Collector’s Night” Themes**

* Event-style promotions like “Complete Your Fossil Set Tonight” or “Vintage Slab Hunt Live 7PM.”

* Bonus: Include how many cards from a set you’ll be auctioning. That shows intent and value.

**Why:** I love checklists. Set-focused streams feel like an efficient use of my time and money.

---

## **🔹 3\. Pop Report Stats or Market Context**

* Marketing that includes quick facts like: “Pop 12 PSA 9 – Last sale $148, ours starts at $85.”

* This feels informative and *collector-savvy*, not just salesy.

**Why:** It saves me time from doing my own research—and proves you know your stuff.

---

## **🔹 4\. Early Access or Insider Perks**

* “First 20 followers get free shipping” or “Loyal buyers get first dibs before stream.”

* VIP or collector-only streams, especially with rare stuff.

**Why:** Makes me feel like part of an *exclusive club*, not just another buyer.

---

## **🔹 5\. Clean, Trustworthy Visuals**

* High-res, no-clutter promos with well-lit card shots.

* Avoid cringe emojis or overhyped language—speak like a collector, not a car salesman.

**Why:** I instantly judge seller credibility by design. Bad graphics \= red flag.

---

## **❌ What I Ignore or Scroll Past:**

* Generic “🔥 Huge auction tonight\! 🔥” without showing actual cards.

* Custom or meme cards front-and-center.

* Sellers showing 10 Charizards in one shot—feels scammy or fake.

---

### Bottom Line:

I click when I believe you:

* Have **cards I want**

* Know **what you’re doing**

* Value **my time** and **collector mindset**
